SCION Applications
==================

This repository contains technical documentation for mature SCION applications.

Before you can use any of the SCION applications, you must have access to a SCION network and have a SCION endhost stack installed on your host.
Start with :doc:`Access and Host configuration <applications/access>` to learn how to configure your host.

.. note::
   This is a work in progress and more applications will be added soon.
   If you are interested in your application being documented here, please contact us.
